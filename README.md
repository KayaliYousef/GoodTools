### How to Use:
1. **Input Files**: Drag and drop the files into the input fields or use the "Navigate" button to select files.
2. **Compare Files**: Click the "Compare" button to generate an HTML file.
    - The HTML file will be saved in the same directory where the program is installed.
    - Open the HTML file in your browser to view the comparison results.

### Features:

  - **Green**: Text added.
  - **Red**: Text removed.
  - **Yellow**: Text edited.

## Process SRT Tab

This tab offers multiple tools to process `.srt` files.

### How to Use:
1. **Input Files**: 
   - Drag and drop files or use the "Navigate" button to select a file.
   - Alternatively, if no file is selected, the program will automatically search the directory where it is saved for `.srt` files. If you press the "Convert Between SRT/VTT" button, it will also detect `.vtt` files.
2. **Output Files**:
   - If files are manually selected, youâ€™ll be prompted to choose a save location.
   - If files are detected automatically, the output will be saved in the same directory as the program.

### Features:
- **Sort SRT**: Sorts the timestamps of `.srt` files if they are out of order.
- **Convert Between SRT/VTT**: Converts files between `.srt` and `.vtt` formats.
- **Clean SRT and Generate TXT**: Removes timestamps, block numbers, and empty lines from `.srt` files and saves the cleaned content as a `.txt` file.
- **Check SRT Sequence**: Checks `.srt` files for common errors:
  1. Timing errors within the same timestamp.
  2. Timing errors between two timestamps.
  3. Block numbering errors.
  4. Extra spaces after block numbers.
  5. Extra empty rows.
  6. Timestamp format errors.
- **Synchronize SRT**: Adjusts the text in `.srt` blocks to fit within specified character limits:
  1. **Normal**: 42 max characters per line, 30 min characters per line.
  2. **Short**: 30 max characters per line, 20 min characters per line.
  3. **Custom**: Set your own min/max character limits using the Min and Max fields. After you press `Synchronize SRT` the values you chose will be saved in `assets/config.json` and if you leave the fields empty the program will read the values from the config file.
  - Optionally, enable "Split at punctuation" to prioritize splitting lines at punctuation marks.

## SRT Prep/Reconstruction Tab

This tab is designed to facilitate translation workflows using tools like ChatGPT, DeepL, or other AI-powered services.

### How to Use:
1. **Prepare for Translation**:
   - Input an `.srt` file and click the "Prep SRT" button.
   - The program generates:
     - A `.json` file containing the original structure.
     - A `.txt` file split into chunks of up to 5000 characters (split at sentence boundaries). The `.txt` file contains only text, without timestamps or block numbers, preserving context for AI translation tools.
2. **Reconstruct SRT**:
   - After translating the `.txt` file, input the translated file and the `.json` file.
   - Click "Reconstruct SRT and Sync" to:
     - Convert the translated text back into `.srt` format using the original structure.
     - Apply synchronization settings ([see synchronization options](#process-srt-tab)).
